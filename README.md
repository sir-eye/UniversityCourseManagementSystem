University Course Management System - Normalization Lab
This project demonstrates the application of First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF) to organize unnormalized data into efficient database structures. The project also includes a Java-based simulation of normalized tables and their relationships, showcasing how to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.

ðŸ“š Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Identify redundancy and anomalies in unnormalized data.
Normalize the data using 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
Simulate the normalized tables (Students, Courses, and Enrollments) in Java.
Console out the results, including a joined view of the normalized data.
ðŸ›  Features
Students Table:

Stores student IDs and names.
Courses Table:

Stores course IDs, names, and instructor details.
Enrollments Table:

Establishes a many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
Data Join:

Combines data from all tables to display complete enrollment information, including student names, course titles, and instructor details.
ðŸš€ How It Works
Normalization:

Converts unnormalized data into normalized tables following 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
Java Simulation:

Implements classes for Student, Course, and Enrollment.
Uses List collections to store table data.
Joins the data programmatically to simulate database relationships.
